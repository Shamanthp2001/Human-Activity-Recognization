# Human-Activity-Recognization Using Deep learning
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that would take the video input from 
different sources like security cameras and recorded videos and detect actions that are being 
performed by the people. This process is commonly referred as HAR (Human Activity 
Recognition) or Human Activity Detection. The project began with the analysis of models 
and procedures that already exist to perform this activity along with the assessment of their 
advantages and disadvantages respectively. There were many approaches to build this 
project that mainly used sensors (tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope) and various 
modelling procedures such as CNN’s (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNN’s (Recurrent 
Neural Networks), DNN’s (Deep Neural Networks) and few Image Processing techniques. 
The goal is to come up with a model that is able to detect a selection of activities on which 
the model was trained during the development phase. The designed model helps to 
overcome the disadvantage of the previously built models that relied on the use of sensors. 
With the elimination of sensors, we eliminate the cost associated with respect to the sensors 
and the errors that can be caused due to the use of sensors
